                            We create interactive and responsive user interfaces (UI) that runs entirely on the
                            frontend with pure Javascript and the React and Angular web application frameworks.
                            React and Angular frameworks enable us to leverage Single Page Applications (SPAs)
                            technology to develop web sites that run entirely on the client side and are therefore
                            more user friendly and efficient than traditional web applications built with page post
                            back technology.

                            Our backends are typically RESTful APIâ€™s that run in the server environment and
                            persist data to a database management system in the cloud such as mongodb atlas. We
                            build robust API backends for our web frontends (and mobile apps) using backend web
                            application development frameworks based on Javascript, Python, C# and Java. Such
                            frameworks include but are not limited to Node.js for Javascript, Flask for Python,
                            Django for Python, ASP.NET for C#, and Spring Boot for Java.

                            Databases can be on premise or cloud hosted and include mongodb, mysql, postgres.
                            We can develop against various types of databases including but not limited to
                            no-sql databases, relational databases, etc. We can help with database schema design,
                            development and implementation. Typically the schema reflects the business problem
                            being solved and hence requires domain knowledge or experts - although this is not
                            necessarily the case.
